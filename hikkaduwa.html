<h1>HIKKADUWA TURTLE HATCHERY</h1><br><br>

<p>The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery, located in the coastal town of Hikkaduwa in Sri Lanka, is a renowned conservation facility dedicated to protecting and preserving sea turtles.<br>
   The hatchery plays a crucial role in ensuring the survival of endangered turtle species by providing a safe environment for the incubation and hatching of turtle eggs.<br>
   The hatchery collects turtle eggs from vulnerable nesting sites, protects them from predators and human disturbance, and monitors their development until they are ready to be released into the ocean.<br>
   The facility also educates visitors about the importance of turtle conservation and the threats facing these majestic creatures, promoting awareness and fostering a sense of responsibility towards their protection.</p><br><br>
